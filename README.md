# ShiSheng's AOSP Project - Homepage

> We'll put the latest information and ROM's download link here below.

## Introduction

A little AOSP project funded by ShiSheng.

We drew inspiration from [$Sudoerz](https://github.com/UP5468-GE-ES44AC)'s umi(Xiaomi 10) project.

_Now, we're working on AOSP for cmi(Xiaomi 10 Pro) **only**._
